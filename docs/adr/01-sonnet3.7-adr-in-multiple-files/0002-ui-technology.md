# UI Technology Selection

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: [list everyone involved in the decision]
* Date: 2025-08-19

## Context and Problem Statement

Having selected Tauri as our desktop application framework, we need to decide on the specific UI technology to use for creating the application interface. This includes considerations for creating semi-transparent windows, multiple windows, and ensuring the UI can work well with the application's unique requirements.

## Decision Drivers

* Compatibility with Tauri framework
* Support for semi-transparent windows
* Ability to create and manage multiple windows efficiently
* Performance considerations, especially when working with AI processing
* Developer experience and productivity
* Ease of customization for specialized UI requirements
* Community support and longevity

## Considered Options

* React with TypeScript
* Vue.js with TypeScript
* Svelte with TypeScript
* Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "React with TypeScript", because it provides a robust ecosystem, strong typing for large applications, and excellent community support while working well with Tauri for our specific requirements.

### Positive Consequences

* Strong typing with TypeScript reduces runtime errors and improves maintainability
* Rich ecosystem of libraries and tools for UI development
* Component-based architecture suitable for complex desktop applications
* Good performance with React's virtual DOM, especially for managing multiple windows
* Large community and corporate backing ensuring long-term support
* Excellent developer tools and debugging experience
* Well-documented integration with Tauri

### Negative Consequences

* Slight learning curve for developers not familiar with React/TypeScript
* Bundle size considerations (though less critical with Tauri than Electron)
* May require additional libraries for some specialized UI features
* React's state management might need careful design for multi-window applications

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### React with TypeScript

* Good, because it has strong typing for safer code and better IDE support
* Good, because it provides component reusability for multiple window interfaces
* Good, because it has a large ecosystem of libraries and tools
* Good, because it offers strong corporate backing and community support
* Good, because it works well with Tauri and has documentation for integration
* Good, because it has well-established patterns for complex state management
* Bad, because it has a steeper learning curve than some alternatives
* Bad, because it may have larger bundle sizes than lighter frameworks (though Tauri mitigates this issue)

### Vue.js with TypeScript

* Good, because it has an approachable learning curve
* Good, because it offers good TypeScript integration
* Good, because it provides good performance characteristics
* Good, because it has solid documentation and growing community
* Bad, because it has a smaller ecosystem than React for specialized desktop UI components
* Bad, because it has less established patterns for multi-window applications
* Bad, because it may have fewer resources specific to Tauri integration

### Svelte with TypeScript

* Good, because it has excellent performance with minimal runtime overhead
* Good, because it offers a simpler development model with less boilerplate
* Good, because it has good TypeScript support
* Good, because it produces smaller bundle sizes
* Bad, because it has a smaller ecosystem and community compared to React and Vue
* Bad, because it has fewer established patterns for complex desktop applications
* Bad, because it may have less documentation for Tauri integration
* Bad, because it may have fewer specialized libraries for features like window transparency management

### Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript

* Good, because it has no framework overhead
* Good, because it offers maximum flexibility for customization
* Good, because it provides direct access to Web APIs without abstractions
* Bad, because it lacks structured patterns for component reuse
* Bad, because it has no built-in state management for complex applications
* Bad, because it requires more boilerplate code
* Bad, because it has limited type safety without additional tooling
* Bad, because it has higher maintenance burden for large applications
